# Rust Mutable vs. Immutable References

This example highlights the core concept of mutable and immutable references in Rust.  Understanding this is crucial for avoiding common errors related to ownership and borrowing.

The `bug.rs` file contains a demonstration of both types of references and shows the effects on the original variable. The `bugSolution.rs` file is not needed in this example since the code in `bug.rs` is already correct and demonstrates the concept effectively.
